This LRU Cache operates at O(n) time. It was my first time creating one.

The homework said to not implement a linked list but I did anyways because I skimmed over the instructions. An assignment that was supposed to take me about 30 minutes took me 2 days. At least I know how to implement a doubly linked list now.

The only thing missing to make this LRU Cache operate at O(1) time is a Hashmap.

Will most likely revisit once I learn how to implement Hashmaps.
